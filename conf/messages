guidance.roro.section.1.header = Exporting from the UK by road and RoRo
guidance.roro.section.1.paragraph.1 = To be ready, you’ll need to:

If you make declarations yourself, you will be able to do this using your software, or by accessing either of the current customs systems directly - the existing {0} or the new system that is replacing CHIEF, the {1}.
guidance.roro.section.1.paragraph.2.link.1 = National Export System
guidance.roro.section.1.paragraph.2.link.2 = CDS export declaration service

guidance.roro.section.2.list.1.bullet.1 = In ‘Type of declaration’ (section 1) select ‘Arrived’. However for Sheerness and Newhaven select pre-lodged.
guidance.roro.section.2.list.1.bullet.2 = For arrived declarations only, on ‘Add the authorisation for this export’ (section 2) select EXRR and enter your EORI number, or the exporter’s if you are an agent. Do not enter CSE even if you hold it.
guidance.roro.section.2.list.1.bullet.3 = In ‘What is the goods location code?’ (section 3) enter one of: <ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet"><li>Dover - GBAUDVRDOVDVRGVM</li><li>Eurotunnel - GBAUEUTEUTEUTGVM</li><li>Dover/Eurotunnel - GBAUDEUDEUDEUGVM</li><li>Fishguard - GBAUFISFISFISGVM</li><li>Holyhead - GBAUHLYHLDHLYGVM</li><li>Liverpool - GBAULIVLIVLIVGVM</li><li>Heysham - GBAUHYMHEYHYMGVM</li><li>Pembroke Dock/Milford Haven - GBAUPEDMILPEDGVM</li><li>Sheerness - GBAUMEDMEDMEDGVM</li><li>Newhaven - GBAUNHVNHVNHVGVM</li></ul>These codes are for the new {0}. For Liverpool, Heysham or Pembroke/Milford Haven, make sure your haulier is using GVMS to handle the movement of the goods. If they are using inventory linking they can advise you the correct code to use.

guidance.roro.section.3.header = Submit the arrived declaration
guidance.roro.section.3.paragraph.1 = You are advised to submit the arrived declaration before the goods leave your (or the trader’s) premises. This will give you a clearance message (permission to progress) which will allow your driver to go straight through to the office of exit. If your goods need to go route 1 or route 2 (documentary or physical checks) you will be notified immediately upon submission of your declaration.
guidance.roro.section.3.paragraph.2 = You must in all cases submit the declaration before the goods arrive at the port.

guidance.roro.section.4.header = Clearance procedures
guidance.roro.section.4.paragraph.1 = Once you’ve submitted the declaration, HMRC will send you a notification giving you a route 1, 2, 3 or 6. The meaning of each of those is:

guidance.roro.section.4.list.1.bullet.1 = Route 1: Documentary checks required – upload documents that support your declaration and wait for permission to progress to be granted or for further instruction
guidance.roro.section.4.list.1.bullet.2 = Route 2: Asks you to upload documents (as for Route 1) and make sure the haulier or driver transports your goods to a designated export place or authorised premises, so that we can make customs checks

guidance.roro.section.5.paragraph.2 = Goods that entered the UK under import reliefs, or subject to excise duty suspension can be recorded when they are re-exported or exported, which help support conclusion of the relief or suspension.

guidance.roro.section.6.header = Documents as proof of departure
guidance.roro.section.6.paragraph.1 = As long as your declaration status shows as ‘Cleared’ you can be satisfied that HMRC will assume that your goods have departed.
guidance.roro.section.6.paragraph.2 = You still need to keep commercial evidence of the export such as boarding tickets, and proof of import. These documents do not need to be provided to NCH for documentary checks but HMRC may ask to see proof of departure.
